### What is Streamlit and what does this app do?
---

According to Streamlit's [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/) -

"Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science.In just a few minutes you can build and deploy powerful data apps."

Having used Streamlit for my own project, I can confirm that it's true. 😉
Thank you Streamlit.

To view this app, make sure you've installed the streamlit library -

`pip install streamlit`

You can run the app as follows -

`streamlit run 1_🏠_Home.py`


>This app is meant to represent a high level overview of the project. Please note that it does not include analysis and results of the ARIMA and SARIMA models that were extensively experimented with in the project, mainly because they didn't fit very well on our data.
