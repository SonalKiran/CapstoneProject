### Notebook Descriptions
---

The notebooks are to be followed in the following order -

- **step_1_data_preparation.ipynb**

	In this notebook we aggregate data from multiple sources, explore the data to build an understanding, and prepare it for further analysis and EDA

- **step_2_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb**

	In this notebook we delve further into our data and perform detailed exploratory data analysis. We also build the baseline models and evaluate performance (RMSE and MAPE).

- **step_3_modeling.ipynb**

	In this final step, we forecast bike rental demand using XGBoost, ARIMA, SARIMA and RNN models.
	We then look at their strengths and weaknesses, and compare model performance (RMSE, RMSLE, MAPE).
